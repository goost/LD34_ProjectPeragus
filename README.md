# Innocent Cherry LD 33 Jam Entry

  - Took me around 24h-48h, I was working on and off for three days
  - I was packing and stuff (last weekend old room), therefore no straightforward time...
  - Annoying Bug: Sometimes, if going right first, one get stucks in red screen. Only restart helps.
  	- This does not happen, when going left first and see the end.
  	- Somebody knows why?
